# gremlinSpringbootQuoteAPI
quote fetcher api


I took about 2 hours to complete as it took me a bit to understand how the api was working. Ideally i would want to add unit tests to this but for the purpose of time i physically ran different scenarios i wanted to test for.

for example: when an invalid variable is given for language, the program requests the user for the input again.

Changes i would make with additional time:
-Looping program to request a new input from user once outputting a quote
-Add additional unit testing
-Add checks for user input
-Better exception handling for api call
