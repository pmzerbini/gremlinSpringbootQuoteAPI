# gremlinSpringbootQuoteAPI
quote fetcher api


I took about 2 hours to complete as it took me a bit to understand how the api was working. Ideally i would want to add unit tests to this but for the purpose of time i physically ran different scenarios i wanted to test for.

for example: when an invalid variable is given for language, the program requests the user for the input again.

If i had more time i would probably make it so the program loops again after providing a quote rather then exiting out and making it so the input would identify alternate values(ex: english, eng) as equivilant valid variables to accepted inputs(EN)
